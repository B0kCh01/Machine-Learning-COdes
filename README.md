# Machine-Learning
I just do a bunch of super easy Machine Learning Programs. 
I started with Decision Trees but now, am exploring Deep Learning and Nueral Networks

## Goal?
I code in Python mainly for these projects and I hope to solve every single problem in the world with machine learning.

## Compatability
I do this on my hackintosh with a virtual enviroment.
I believe that my programs can run on similar setups.

Python 3.6.5 is used becuase I find this version the most stable in this sort of stuff.

## To-Do
- [x] ~~*Understand basics of ML*~~
- [x] ~~*Write my first ML model*~~
- [ ] *Write Neural Networks*
   * - [ ] ~~ANN~~
   * - [ ] CNN (Not as muchn as I wanted to)
   * - [ ] RNN
- [ ] *Explore some crazy Deep Learning Algrithms*
   * - [ ] GAN
  
- [ ] *Write a Neural Network from scratch with numpy only*
