# Machine Learning
I just do a bunch of Machine Learning programs. 
Currently, I am exploring Deep Learning and Neural Networks

## Goal?
I code in Python and I hope to create a Machine Learning program so smart that it solves problems that are beyond human comprehension. 

## Compatability
I create and train models using UBUNTU 18.10 and WINDOWS 10, usually within a virtual enviroment.
I believe that my programs can run on all computers supporting the latest version of tensorflow.

Python 3 is used becuase I find this version the most popular among this field.
