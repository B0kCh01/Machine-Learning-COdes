# Machine-Learning
I just do a bunch of super easy Machine Learning Programs. 
I started with Decision Trees but now exploring the nuerel nets

## Goal?
I code in Python mainly for these projects and I hope to solve every single problem in the world with machine learning.

## Compatability
I do this on my hackintosh with a virtual enviroment.
I believe that my programs can run on similar setups.

Python 3.6.5 is used becuase I find this version the most stable in this sort of stuff.
