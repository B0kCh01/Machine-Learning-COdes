# Machine-Learning
I just do a bunch of super easy Machine Learning Scripts. 
Mostly decision trees for now.
## Goal?
I code in Python mainly for these projects and I hope to do something more complicated when I am better at math.

## Compatability
I do this on my hackintosh. I don't have windows installed currently so I cannot test my scripts' compatibility with that operating system. Most the of the scripts should be very very easy to understand and can be slighty changed to have support for Windows.

Python 3 is used. Don't use python 2.
