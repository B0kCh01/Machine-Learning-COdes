# Machine Learning
I just do a bunch of Machine Learning programs. 
Currently, I am exploring Deep Learning and Neural Networks

## Goal?
I code in Python and I hope to create a Machine Learning program so smart that it solves problems that are beyond human comprehension. 

## Compatability
I create and train models using UBUNTU 18.10 and WINDOWS 10, usually within a virtual enviroment.
I believe that my programs can run on all computers supporting the latest version of tensorflow.

Python 3 is used becuase I find this version the most popular among this field.

## To-Do
- [x] ~~*Understand basics of ML*~~
- [x] ~~*Write my first ML model*~~
- [ ] *Write Neural Networks*
   * - [ ] ~~ANN~~
   * - [ ] CNN (Not as much as I wanted to)
   * - [ ] RNN
- [ ] *Explore some crazy Deep Learning Algrithms*
   * - [ ] GAN
   * - [ ] NLP
  
- [ ] *Write a Neural Network from scratch with numpy only*
