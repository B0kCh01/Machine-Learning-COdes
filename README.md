# Machine-Learning
I just do a bunch of super easy Machine Learning Programs. 
I started with Decision Trees but now, am exploring Deep Learning and Nueral Networks

## Goal?
I code in Python mainly for these projects and I hope to solve every single problem in the world with machine learning.

## Compatability
I do this on my hackintosh with a virtual enviroment.
I believe that my programs can run on similar setups.

Python 3.6.5 is used becuase I find this version the most stable in this sort of stuff.

## To-Do
1. ~~Understand basics of ML~~
2. ~~Write my first ML model~~
3. Write a Neural Network
  a. ~~ANN~~
  b. CNN
  c. RNN
4. Explore some crzy Deep Learning Algrithms
  a. GAN
5. Write a Neural Network from scratch with numpy only
