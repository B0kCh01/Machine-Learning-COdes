# Machine Learning
I just do a bunch of Machine Learning programs. 
Currently, I am exploring Deep Learning and Neural Networks

## Goal?
I code in Python and I hope to create a Machine Learning program so smart that it solves problems that are beyond human comprehension. 

## Compatability
I create and train models using UBUNTU 18.10 and WINDOWS 10, usually within a virtual enviroment.
I believe that my programs can run on all computers supporting the latest version of tensorflow.

Python 3 is used becuase I find this version the most popular among this field.

## Sample
I usually comment on my code with some commentary and explanations so that more people can understand the "harder" concepts.
If you catch a mistake, please tell me by posting an issue - I'll fix it ASAP.
Here is an sample of what you'll see in my code:

```
# The fit method helps our model learn. x and y represent the training set inputs and outputs, respectively.
# An epoch is one whole iteration of feeding the whole dataset into the model. (Round trip)
# VERBOSE is an optinal parameter that controls how much info we get. 0 means no output in console while training
model.fit(x=x, y=y, epochs=100, verbose=0)
```
Of course, that was a bit of an exagerated explanation, but you get the idea. The code is beginner friendly, and it also helps me!

You can possibly understand the code better = **win** <br>
Teaching helps me understand concepts better = **win**
