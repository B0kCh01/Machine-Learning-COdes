# Heart Disease UCI
## About
Just browsing Kaggle to find some datasets to explore.

I wanted to start a bit easy so I took the heart disease dataset and built a Neural Network, trying to predict if a patient has heart disease or not.

## Libraries
- Tensorflow 2.0
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Python 3.6

## Steps to run
1. Download the python script and the dataset
2. Make sure it's placed in the same folder
3. With your favorite terminal enviroment, run:
```
python heart.py
```
