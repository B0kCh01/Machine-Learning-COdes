I tried to mimic an abstract written by PHD Students. Doesn't look that great


# Keras' Fit Function Performance Versus Tensorflow Implementation

## Abstract
Training deep neural networks are one of the most computationally expensive and time consuming tasks in computer science. It's one of the main issues with researching or using neural nets because it takes so much time to view overall improvement. To figure out the best way to train a simple neural network, I compared keras' .fit() function on the Sequential Function and Tensoflow's @tf.function train algorithm. I concluded that keras' .fit() function is a lot faster and it is  recommended to use .fit() to save time and precious cloud computing hours.
