# IRIS Flower Classifier
![alt text](images/cover_image.jpg "A Iris Flower")
## About
This is a simple Neural Network classifier built on the IRIS dataset
This is my FIRST Neural Network implementaion. (Although overkill)

This classifier can tell the difference between differents types of the iris flower by the different features of the plant.

## Compatibility
Most of it doesn't work, but its one of my biggest milestones, so I won't update this one. 

All you need is:
1. keras or keras from tensorflow
2. sklearn (train,test split)
