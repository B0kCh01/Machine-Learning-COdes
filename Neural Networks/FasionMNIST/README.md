# FashionMNIST Classifier
![alt text](images/cover_image.jpg "FashionMNIST Dataset")
## About
This is one of the first image classifiers I've played with, and one of the most popular "Hello World" Image Classification datasets. 

## Compatibility
This was created a while ago and it is kinda of my milestone, so I will not plan to update it.
However, it uses keras (eager execution) and should not be outdated anytime soon.

But you must have the following:
1. tensorflow
2. numpy
3. matplotlib (plt)

## Resources
I followed this tutorial:
