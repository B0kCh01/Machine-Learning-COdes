# Why there are two folders
Nowadays, it is super easy to build nueral networks. 
By using libraries, you can get the job done quicker than every before.
## The two libraries
Currently, there are two dominating libraries:
1. Tensorflow
2. PyTorch

Both have thier pros and cons, so why not use both?

## Compatibilty
I try to make all of these programs compatible with all operating systems that support python, tensorflow, and keras.

## Installation
You can visit tensorflows wesite here: <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip">Tensorflow</a>
For MacOS, it is **important** to setup a seperate enviroment for python to run on with pyenv or conda. 

Python version 3.7 (windows), 3.6 or 3.5 is recommended for full compatibility with the packages. 
After that, installation is as easy as 

```
python -m pip install tensorflow
```
or in general:

```
python -m pip install <package name>
```

any other packages needed can be installed in the same way! 

You can download the file directly and run it with
```
python [filename].py
```

ðŸ¦¾ Enjoy!
