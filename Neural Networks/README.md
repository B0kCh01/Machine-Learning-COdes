# Neural Network
I do classification problems with this type of model

## Compatibilty
I try to make all of these programs compatible with all operating systems that support python, tensorflow, and keras.

## Installation
You can visit tensorflows wesite here: <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip">Tensorflow</a>
For MacOS, it is **important** to setup a seperate enviroment for python to run on with venv or conda. 

Python version 3.6 or 3.5 is recommended for full compatibility with the packages. 
After that, installation is as easy as 

```
pip install tensorflow
```

and

```
pip install scikit-learn
```

any other packages needed can be installed in the same way! 

You can download the file directly as a raw file and run it with
```
python [filename].py
```

Enjoy!
